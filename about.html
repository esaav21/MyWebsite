            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am Eduardo Saavedra, a recent graduate with a Master of Science in Business Analytics from the University of California, Davis. Having completed my degree in June with a 3.5 GPA, I am currently exploring opportunities as a data analyst or business analyst. My education has equipped me with comprehensive knowledge of industry-standard tools such as SQL, Python, R, Tableau, Hadoop, Spark, Zookeeper, web scraping, and MongoDB. I also have BS is in Managerial Economics from UC Davis.

                One of my proudest achievements was a big data project that I worked on with a few friends. We utilized images from the European Space Agency's Sentinel 2 satellite and developed a classification algorithm to geo-locate areas of recent urban development. This project aimed to identify potential investment opportunities by analyzing urban growth patterns, showcasing the practical applications of data analytics in real-world scenarios.

                During my master's program, I developed a keen interest in machine learning, particularly through a challenging course where I went from having no prior experience in Python to coding my own machine learning algorithms from scratch. In this course, my team and I worked on a project using clinical data to predict factors contributing to heart failure mortality. By employing advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, we aimed to enhance the prediction accuracy of heart failure outcomes, providing actionable insights for healthcare decision-making and patient care strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
                My short-term goal is to secure a business analytics role where I can apply and expand my skill set. In the long term, I aspire to manage a team of business analysts, driving growth and success within the organization I work for. I am passionate about leveraging data to make informed decisions and solve complex problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy a range of activities including working out, listening to and occasionally playing music, reading, and gaming. These hobbies help me maintain a balanced lifestyle and often provide fresh perspectives on the challenges I encounter in my professional work.
